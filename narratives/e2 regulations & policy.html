<h2>Proactive regulations & policy</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p>A trusted regulatory framework, coordinated policies, and agile and forward-looking standards will accelerate assurance within UK manufacturing</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p>Agile regulatory and policy framework and promotion and protection of intellectual property</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p>The UK’s rich standards legacy, ethical environment and expertise in metrology and carbon accounting mean it is in a good position to take advantage</p><p></p>
<h3>Global outlook</h3>
<h5>Intro</h5><p>Regulatory frameworks are trusted to promote innovation and to protect intellectual property. The frameworks are forward-looking and facilitate innovation by creating markets and a conducive environment to incentivise new manufacturing business models. The benefits of standards and regulations are recognised, and their use is stimulated by electronic access.</p>
<h4>Globally trusted standards</h4><p>Trust in the regulatory system needs to transform to support dynamic innovation. The UK is in a good position to drive this transition with a consistent policy framework supported by leading standards bodies. UK approaches to business and machine ethics can become the de facto global standard. The UK can leverage its global soft power and provide leadership in international bodies supporting a drive to global alignment.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are creative commons licences. Other trends are global soft power, UK's rich standards legacy, IP valuation, TRIZ solution search. There are also challenges such as counterfeit prevention, AI & machine ethics, moral agency, explainability.</p>
<h4>Forward-looking regulatory framework</h4><p>Policies, regulations and standards need to be more proactive and dynamic. The UK’s legacy in standards development, stable regulatory framework and digitised regulation experience give a strong platform. Physical and virtual ‘living labs’ can be used to develop and test agile national and international standards. The UK can lead the development of artificial intelligence to support causal platforms to protect and use patents and to better match problems, solutions and inventors.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are flex standards. Other trends are ecosystem forward strategies. There are also challenges such as promoting disruptive inventions, unicorn domination, long standards approval timelines.</p>
<h4>Regulations perceived as purposeful</h4><p>All policies, regulations and standards need to have well-explained benefits that can be measured. The UK can build on experience in regulation to ensure systems are in place to enable benefits tracking, carbon accounting standardisation, and GHG measurements. The UK’s expertise in metrology will bring GHG measurement standards into practice. The ONS sector coding can be adopted to meaningfully allocate and monitor net zero contributions across the manufacturing sectors.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are regulation benefits tracking. Other trends are carbon accounting standards, GHG measurements, standard industrial classifications (SIC), joined-up approaches, policy continuity. There are also challenges such as public purpose, definition of 'green', definition of 'value added', misinformation, incrementalism.</p>
<h4>Accessible regulatory framework</h4><p>The regulatory framework needs to transition to provide real time compliance checks. The UK’s strength in standards development gives the opportunity to lead the use of technology such as distributed ledgers and application programming interfaces (APIs) for real time compliance, taxation, and royalty payouts. It can also enable design standards to be embedded in all products throughout their life.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are digitisation. Other trends are links between standards, application programming interface (API) integration.</p>
