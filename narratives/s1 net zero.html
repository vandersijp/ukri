<h5>Scope</h5><p>To understand the environmental impact of every stage in the supply chain and manufacturing process and widely adopting sustainable practices</p><p></p><h5>Scope</h5><p>To be agile and mitigate risks arising from the changing global economy, interruptions to supply of critical minerals and materials, national and global disruptions, and climate change</p><p></p><h5>Scope</h5><p>To improve efficiency across supply chains, enable novel business models, support whole-system design and deliver highly customised products.</p><p></p>
<h3>Vision</h3><h3>Vision</h3><h3>Vision</h3>
<p>A net zero and resource-efficient UK sector will understand environmental impact across the full lifecycle, including emissions embedded in raw materials, in distribution, in manufacture, in use and at end of life, whether these activities occur in the UK or overseas.</p><p>Companies will clearly see and be aware of the risks of disruption across all their operations. Manufacturers will adopt autonomous systems that allow them to rapidly adapt to maintain and even improve operations during periods of disruption with limited investment of time and money.</p><p>Digital technologies and a digital thread will allow companies to view every stage in the supply chain and manufacturing process. Manufacturing facilities and supply chains will be connected, networked, and fully integrated, allowing live analysis and optimisation.</p>
<p>Regulatory requirements will make clean and resource-efficient business models the most profitable. UK businesses will be recognised as global leaders in sustainability and this will enhance their competitiveness.</p><p>Resilience of supply will improve to meet society’s needs and mitigate the risk from interruptions to supply of critical minerals and materials, national and global disruptions, and climate change. Critical minerals, materials and products will be more secure, being increasingly sourced, substituted, made or reused in the UK.</p><p>The UK will be a leader in the development and export of industrial digital technologies and the associated information management, and their application will be widespread.</p>
<p>Businesses will seek to extract the full value from resources, minimise waste and deliver a circular economy. Activity will ultimately be regenerative, restoring rather than exploiting resources, such that manufacturing makes a net-positive contribution to achieving climate targets.</p><p>Companies will be responsive to market patterns, capable of rapidly repurposing production to meet demand. Digital and other technologies will be used to maximise resilience against cyber and other threats.</p><p>Processes will be easily customised and provide customers with products they want at the right time and cost.</p>
<p>Design engineering will be optimised to reduce material use and human-centred to help reduce and manage demand. Recycling and reuse will be increased, and product life will be greatly improved.</p><p>Gaps in skills needed to deliver will be closed through anticipating those needs and upskilling. Strategic partnerships and collaboration will be built to expand capacity and strengthen capability.</p><p>The efficiency, productivity and accuracy gains will catalyse UK manufacturing, leading to extensive reshoring of strategically important supply chains. Emerging and enabling technologies will be rapidly and widely embraced.</p>
<p>Product use and sharing will increase, and materials that we see as ‘waste’ today will be valued. These materials will be sold into new markets or adapted as a feedstock for production of chemicals, low-carbon fuels and materials (for example through catalytic or biotechnological processes), reducing reliance on virgin feedstocks.</p><p>Organisations will have the leadership, management, and technical capability to anticipate and exploit multiple challenges, ensuring resilience in the face of a highly uncertain and demanding world.</p><p>Improved competitiveness will be supported through national and international research, innovation and collaboration, enabling the UK to export solutions globally, providing new jobs industrial growth, and economic benefit.</p>
