<h2>Resilient supply chains</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p>Complete supply chain visibility, sustainable feedstocks, bio-based chemical replacements, and co-location of waste and emission streams</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p>Procurement of raw materials and components, and the repurposing of emissions, solid waste and industrial water back into manufacturing</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p>The UK has a strong reclamation culture and the materials recycling expertise to take advantage. It is also well placed to embrace servitisation and benefits from a strong research and technology organisation (RTO) network including the High Value Manufacturing Catapult</p><p></p>

<h3>Global outlook</h3>
<h5>Intro</h5><p>Change to process, demand or supply brings uncertainty and increases the risk of disruption. This uncertainty increases costs and waste and reduces or, in some cases, stops value creation. Businesses manage this uncertainty through scenario planning, contingency mapping and the taking of calculated risks. By enabling companies to deal with uncertainty, we create more resilient supply chains, which, in turn, create more value with less cost and less waste.</p>
<h4>Robust supply chains</h4><p>By 2030, we see almost ubiquitous use of analytics to significantly increase visibility across the whole supply chain. By 2040, this drives aligned decisions and reduces waste and cost. In 2050, we see a robust manufacturing supply chain with deep understanding of threats and opportunities. Some risks, such as natural disasters, remain and require mitigation. Redundancy in the supply chain continues to be necessary, although applied in a transparent way, minimising waste whilst mitigating the risk. Similarly, some geo-political risks beyond the control of companies are mitigated by reshoring strategically key manufacturing supply chains.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are data provenance, serialisation, end-to-end visibility of risks. Other trends are predictive analytics, agent based modelling (ABM), transponders in containers, tier-one suppliers, visibility of sub-tiers, procurement, just-in-time, hedging, insurance policies. There are also challenges such as threat intelligence, data trust, supply chain data sensitivity.</p>
<h4>Cooperation in manufacturing supply chain</h4><p>The resilient supply chain of 2050 is highly cooperative. Flows of information and data are secure but shared across organisational boundaries and allow system-level optimisation. By 2030, procurement of equipment and components is consistently weighted towards environmental benefit and, by 2040, all primary materials are sustainably and reliably sourced. Carbon disclosure schemes are common and recognised. Trusted and transparent data flows openly to and from suppliers, producers and end-users.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are nearshoring, greenshoring, friend-shoring. Other trends are critical raw materials, sovereignty, lunar mining, components, sub-assemblies, offshoring, localisation, reshoring, foraging factories. There are also challenges such as rare earth metals, critical minerals, carbon leakage detection, embedded carbon, border adjustments.</p>
<h4>Symbiotic industrial processes</h4><p>By 2040, waste sites and feedstock sites are commonly located together. Industrial closed loop water systems are applied as standard and water leakages are eliminated. By 2050, catalysis and industrial biotechnology have enabled the use of biomass and recycled feedstocks for the production of chemicals and materials rather than virgin feedstocks. Dependency on imported primary raw materials is reduced creating new supply chains in secondary raw materials.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are CCU in combination with hydrogen, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), waste-to-product, waste-to-worth, reverse logistics, industrial symbiosis, waste plastic valorisation, water stewardships, catalysis, enzymes, bio-innovation, bio-informatics, bioplants, biomanufacturing, industrial biotechnology, engineering biology, synthetic biology, deep biotechnology, biofoundries, viral vector manufacturing, molecular farming, bioeconomy, traceability. Other trends are carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS), solar fuels, low-carbon fuels to low-carbon chemicals, artificial trees, biogenic wastes and residues, biomass valorisation, ion exchange resin regeneration, water treatment, process-critical closed water loops, high ionicity water treatment, phosphorus removal from water, carbon accounting, biomass valorisation, waste plastic valorisation, autonomous transport. There are also challenges such as microplastics removal, water stress, water leakages, greenwashing.</p>




<h3>UK vision 2050</h3>
<h4>Robust supply chains</h4><p>Improving visibility through complex supply chains, transparency of data including global information on materials, and forecasting using agent-based models and digital twins will result in significant productivity gains, cost savings and improved resilience. UK manufacturers are well placed to co-develop and adopt these technologies, working with UK leaders in software design and development. The UK will build its own machines, critical components and software more locally, eliminating the historic dependence on other countries. The UK will secure its need for critical materials, find alternatives to rare earth metals, and replace chemicals with bio-based feedstocks. To implement this safely, trust will be critical and the UK’s leading position in cyber security and broader security approaches will be a critical advantage for UK manufacturers.</p>
<h4>Cooperation in manufacturing supply chain</h4><p>Carbon accounting and disclosure schemes will allow buyers to make informed decisions, including end customers. The UK is a recognised leader in developing standards. UK companies are well placed to develop and adopt novel approaches to help them make informed supply chain decisions, giving them an edge in markets moving towards sustainable products. The UK can implement mechanisms and business models to facilitate and incentivise data sharing.</p>
<h4>Symbiotic industrial processes</h4><p>The UK’s strong reclamation culture can be exploited across multiple sectors to enable the UK to adopt more closed-loop systems. Early adoption helps not only because green credentials give a commercial advantage in the market, but also because it reduces risk and secures supply of materials, allowing for cost reduction whilst delivering stronger reliability to the market.</p>
