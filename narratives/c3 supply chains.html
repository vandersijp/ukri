<h2>Resilient supply chains</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p class="cap">Complete supply chain visibility, sustainable feedstocks, bio-based chemical replacements, and co-location of waste and emission streams</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p class="cap">Automated and adaptive manufacturing, productivity enhancement, predictive maintenance, biomanufacture and resource efficiency</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p class="cap">The UK has many strengths that set it apart, including economy of scale for large factories, long tradition of foundation industries, focus on high-value manufacturing, and strong automotive and aerospace industries. In addition the UK benefits from a supportive network of research and technology organisations including Catapult centres to help scale businesses rapidly</p><p></p>

<h3>Global outlook</h3>

<h5>Intro</h5><p>Change to process, demand or supply brings uncertainty and increases the risk of disruption. This uncertainty increases costs and waste and reduces or, in some cases, stops value creation. Businesses manage this uncertainty through scenario planning, contingency mapping and the taking of calculated risks. By enabling companies to deal with uncertainty, we create more resilient supply chains, which, in turn, create more value with less cost and less waste.</p>

<h4>Robust supply chains</h4><p>Improving visibility through complex supply chains, transparency of data including global information on materials, and forecasting using agent-based models and digital twins will result in significant productivity gains, cost savings and improved resilience. UK manufacturers are well placed to co-develop and adopt these technologies, working with UK leaders in software design and development. The UK will build its own machines, critical components and software more locally, eliminating the historic dependence on other countries. The UK will secure its need for critical materials, find alternatives to rare earth metals, and replace chemicals with bio-based feedstocks. To implement this safely, trust will be critical and the UK’s leading position in cyber security and broader security approaches will be a critical advantage for UK manufacturers.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are data provenance, serialisation, end-to-end visibility of risks. Other trends are predictive analytics, agent based modelling (ABM), transponders in containers, tier-one suppliers, visibility of sub-tiers, procurement, just-in-time, hedging, insurance policies. There are also challenges such as threat intelligence, data trust, supply chain data sensitivity.</p>
<h4>Cooperation in manufacturing supply chain</h4><p>Carbon accounting and disclosure schemes will allow buyers to make informed decisions, including end customers. The UK is a recognised leader in developing standards. UK companies are well placed to develop and adopt novel approaches to help them make informed supply chain decisions, giving them an edge in markets moving towards sustainable products. The UK can implement mechanisms and business models to facilitate and incentivise data sharing.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are nearshoring, greenshoring, friend-shoring. Other trends are critical raw materials, sovereignty, lunar mining, components, sub-assemblies, offshoring, localisation, reshoring, foraging factories. There are also challenges such as rare earth metals, critical minerals, carbon leakage detection, embedded carbon, border adjustments.</p>
<h4>Symbiotic industrial processes</h4><p>The UK’s strong reclamation culture can be exploited across multiple sectors to enable the UK to adopt more closed-loop systems. Early adoption helps not only because green credentials give a commercial advantage in the market, but also because it reduces risk and secures supply of materials, allowing for cost reduction whilst delivering stronger reliability to the market.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are CCU in combination with hydrogen, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), waste-to-product, waste-to-worth, reverse logistics, industrial symbiosis, waste plastic valorisation, water stewardships, catalysis, enzymes, bio-innovation, bio-informatics, bioplants, biomanufacturing, industrial biotechnology, engineering biology, bioeconomy, traceability. Other trends are carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS), solar fuels, low-carbon fuels to low-carbon chemicals, artificial trees, biogenic wastes and residues, biomass valorisation, ion exchange resin regeneration, water treatment, process-critical closed water loops, high ionicity water treatment, phosphorus removal from water, synthetic biology, carbon accounting, biomass valorisation, waste plastic valorisation, autonomous transport. There are also challenges such as microplastics removal, water stress, water leakages, greenwashing.</p>
