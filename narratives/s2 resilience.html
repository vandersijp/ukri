<h2>resilient and responsive</h2>
<h5>scope</h5><p class="cap">To be agile and mitigate risks arising from the changing global economy, interruptions to supply of critical minerals and materials, national and global disruptions, and climate change</p><p></p>

<h3>vision</h3>
<p>Companies will clearly see and be aware of the risks of disruption across all their operations. Manufacturers will adopt autonomous systems that allow them to rapidly adapt to maintain and even improve operations during periods of disruption with limited investment of time and money.</p>
<p>Resilience of supply will improve to meet societyâ€™s needs and mitigate the risk from interruptions to supply of critical minerals and materials, national and global disruptions, and climate change. Critical minerals, materials and products will be more secure, being increasingly sourced, substituted, made or reused in the UK.</p>
<p>Companies will be responsive to market patterns, capable of rapidly repurposing production to meet demand. Digital and other technologies will be used to maximise resilience against cyber and other threats.</p>
<p>Gaps in skills needed to deliver will be closed through anticipating those needs and upskilling. Strategic partnerships and collaboration will be built to expand capacity and strengthen capability.</p>
<p>Organisations will have the leadership, management, and technical capability to anticipate and exploit multiple challenges, ensuring resilience in the face of a highly uncertain and demanding world.</p>
