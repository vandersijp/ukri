<h2>Materials for the future economy</h2>
<h5>vision</h5><p class="cap">Bio-based materials, functional materials, material applications for cutting-edge products that reduce emissions, energy consumption and costs</p><p></p>
<h5>scope</h5><p class="cap">Through-life and multidisciplinary design engineering with support of digital tools to de-risk and prototype new ideas</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p class="cap">UK strengths in high-value design, complex systems with through-life engineering and digital technologies and information management can set us apart from global competition</p><p></p>

<h3>global outlook</h3>

<h5>intro</h5><p>The rapid discovery with broad adoption and efficient processing of advanced and sustainable materials underpin decarbonised economies and have strengthened resilience in supply chains.</p>

<h4>The support of materials with policies</h4><p>The development of next generation materials will need to be incentivised and aligned around common challenges. UK expertise in data science can support material provenance and forensic performance analysis. With organisations like National Physical Laboratory, UK can use its leadership in materials science research, materials data quality, and engineering to accelerate the development of standards. This can be supported with a UK materials strategy and a nationwide intelligent materials database that matches problems with solutions and suppliers.</p><h5>trends and challenges</h5><p> Other trends are materials research coordination, materials databases. There are also challenges such as lacking national strategy.</p>
<h4>Materials for sustainable products</h4><p>Consumer goods and packaging will need to be increasingly sustainable. The UK has expertise in design for sustainability and the development and production of sustainable chemicals, materials, and smart packaging at scale. The UK can generate significant revenue through licensing of novel materials, in particular for materials that are critical to the hydrogen economy. Environmental and regulatory policies can encourage investment in new and sustainable materials, and incentivise the widespread use of recycled materials.</p><h5>trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are intelligent packaging, resource dynamics, biodegradable materials, reversible electrolysers. Other trends are bio-based materials, bio-resins, agro-based materials, gas network retrofitting for H2, water electrolysers, H2 fuel cells, materials for H2 storage & transport. There are also challenges such as composite packaging.</p>
<h4>Broad adoption of new materials</h4><p>It will be essential for new materials and novel applications of existing materials to be rapidly and widely adopted. UK aerospace is leading in light-weighting and the adoption of composites and will spin out revolutionary energy-saving materials across sectors. UK can integrate its expertise in photonics and precision sensors in advanced autonomous production systems. The adoption of sustainable construction materials can transform the UK industry and grow exports.</p><h5>trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are 3D weaving, composite braiding, in-orbit manufacturing, 4D printing, autonomous materials, programmanble materials, materials 4.0, materials genome, nano materials, 2D crystals, membranes, graphene, low-cost sensors, micro-electromechanical system (MEMS), compound semiconductors, metamaterials, optical metadevices, digital biology. Other trends are advanced metallurgy, joining technologies, powder technologies, microgravity materials, coatings, self-healing materials, memory-shape alloys, protein folding, quantum sensors, smart packaging, materials informatics, digital materials. </p>
<h4>Rapid discovery of new materials</h4><p>It will be increasingly important to accelerate the discovery of new materials. The UK leads in metamaterials, advanced metallurgy, electrochemical machining, 3D weaving, and in-orbit manufacturing and holds the most valuable patents for 2D crystals, nano materials, sensors and sensor fusion. The UK establishes itself as the global centre for materials informatics and computational materials for designing next-generation materials (Materials 4.0).</p><h5>trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are composites, compliant structures, quantum cascade lasers, fiber-optics, plasmonics. Other trends are topology optimisation, optical scanning, lithography, photonic sensors, adaptive optics, precision-optics, quantum technology. </p>
