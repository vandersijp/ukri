<h2>Networked relations</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p>Collaborative networks, open knowledge sharing platforms, and aligned investment will energise manufacturing</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p>Connections between all communities and individuals working on innovation</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p>The UK has many advantages including a thriving network of researchers, developers and investors, a strong Catapults network, ambitious industrial policies, and leadership in areas such as food safety and traceability, use of data and cyber security</p><p></p>
<h3>Global outlook</h3>
<h5>Intro</h5><p>Collaboration is essential to deliver thriving, clean and resilient sectors. To collaborate effectively we will share a common vision, work from common assumptions, appropriately share data and information with trusted partners, and create the environment for step-change innovation.</p>
<h4>Open and inclusive networks</h4><p>Improving visibility through the supply chain and forecasting will provide critical communication routes. Making some of this information more open and available to more potential solution suppliers will deliver better understood requirements, more inclusive designs and ultimately better products and services.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are crowd-sourcing, hackerspaces. Other trends are fringe inclusion, scenes recognition. There are also challenges such as 'weak signal' detection, diversity & inclusiveness.</p>
<h4>Collaborative inter-network connections</h4><p>UK manufacturers are well placed to co-develop and adopt these technologies, working with UK-based leaders in software design and development. To implement safely, trust will be critical, and the UK’s leading position in cyber security and broader security approaches will be a critical advantage for UK manufacturers.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are open innovation, manufacturing open-source, open hardware, knowledge transfer networks. Other trends are solver networks, best practices identification, practices replication.</p>
<h4>Diffusive networks for sharing knowledge</h4><p>The UK has well established communities and support to build new communities. This includes sectors working with academia and regulators. Further development of this, and closer working with regulators on an agile and supportive regulatory environment, will give the UK a competitive advantage through the rapid changes of the coming decades.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are local enterprise partnerships, cross-sector connections, multiparty ERP federations. Other trends are industry consultations, international collaborations, benchmarking.</p>
<h4>Coordinated calls for ideas</h4><p>Networked relations can achieve a truly common vision, with common assumptions leading to better aligned investments. Whilst complex to coordinate and deliver, the benefits are significant and mean goals are reached more quickly and at a lower cost for all. The UK has demonstrated its willingness to put forward bold ambitions, and communities have formed to share information and co-develop roadmaps and strategies. There is significant value to gain by going to additional levels of detail with trusted partners and maintaining them.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are incubators, pitch events, demonstrators. Other trends are thought leadership, knowledge curation, challenge competitions, accelerators, portfolio management, project management.</p>
