<h2>Clean energy</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p class="cap">A decarbonised, affordable and secure energy system will power UK manufacturing</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p class="cap">Through-life and multidisciplinary design engineering with support of digital tools to de-risk and prototype new ideas</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p class="cap">UK strengths in high-value design, complex systems with through-life engineering and digital technologies and information management can set us apart from global competition</p><p></p>

<h3>Global outlook</h3>

<h5>Intro</h5><p>The generation and use of clean energy is essential to reaching net zero. Decarbonisation is driven by electrification and increased use of hydrogen and ammonia as a fuel. Resilience and reliability is ensured by a supply that includes distributed power generation as part of a network of smart grids. Competitiveness is enhanced by increased efficiency, more affordable and secure energy and intelligent pricing mechanisms.</p>

<h4>Decarbonised manufacturing system</h4><p>The power supply to all manufacturing needs to be generated from low carbon sources. The UK is well positioned to build on a strong industry to ensure a smooth energy transition. Expertise in whole system integration design and management can be leveraged to develop cost-effective long-duration energy storage. The UK has the opportunity to develop a hydrogen/ammonia grid to fuel industry and transport, supported by electrification of industrial processes. The UK can continue to build capability in the design, manufacture and through-life services to support the introduction and operation of future UK decarbonised energy supply and distribution systems.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen economy, battery technologies. Other trends are wind energy, solar energy, foundation industries, syngas as a vector to produce chemicals, long-duration energy storage (LDES), retrofitting for H2, decarbonisation, electrification, vertical bi-facial PV panels. There are also challenges such as security of power supply.</p>
<h4>Affordable and accessible energy</h4><p>Energy efficiency measures need to be universally adopted. The UK is well paced to develop and implement these measures building on network expertise and leading system integration capability. The UK can build heat networks to prevent, recover or distribute all low-grade waste heat. Factories can optimise energy costs with transparent price predictions and fair feed-in tariffs.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are district heating, distributed solar. Other trends are heat recovery. There are also challenges such as cloud storage energy intensity, feed-in tariffs, levelised cost of energy, fossil fuel price volatility.</p>
<h4>Reliable supply of power</h4><p>UK manufacturing needs a resilient power supply. The UK has capabilities to establish power and hydrogen factory- to-grid systems that accommodate multiple complex business models. Building on UK strengths fossil fuels can be fully displaced by renewables and small modular reactors to provide power supply inertia. Former refinery complexes can be transformed into clean energy parks. Manufacturers can create opportunity through local clean power generation with any excess being fed-in to the grid.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are smart grids, factory-to-grid, fuel switching, phase change materials. Other trends are regional energy parks, small modular reactors. There are also challenges such as energy transition pace.</p>
