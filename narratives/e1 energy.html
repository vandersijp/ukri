<h2>Clean energy</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p>Decarbonised, affordable and secure energy will power energy-efficient UK manufacturing</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p>Development and adoption of a decarbonised manufacturing system founded on a reliable, affordable and clean energy supply</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p>Strong offshore technologies, wind turbine, hydroelectric and solar industry, developing battery supply chain, and nuclear research and development give the UK a strong advantage</p><p></p>

<h3>Global outlook</h3>
<h5>Intro</h5><p>The generation and use of clean energy is essential to reaching net zero. Decarbonisation is driven by electrification and increased use of hydrogen and ammonia as a fuel. Resilience and reliability is ensured by a supply that includes distributed power generation as part of a network of smart grids. Competitiveness is enhanced by increased efficiency, more affordable and secure energy and intelligent pricing mechanisms.</p>
<h4>Decarbonised manufacturing system</h4><p>Power is generated from low-carbon sources supported by cost-effective long-duration energy storage systems. Clean energy grids are used to fuel industry, and zero or low carbon transport is the norm throughout the logistics chain. Electrification of industrial processes drives decarbonisation and achievement of net zero. Greenhouse gas mitigating measures are identified that can be implemented quickly. The dichotomy between clean, affordable and reliable energy is no longer a compromise. Business models that monetise negative emissions are the norm.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen economy, battery technologies. Other trends are wind energy, solar energy, foundation industries, syngas as a vector to produce chemicals, long-duration energy storage (LDES), retrofitting for H2, decarbonisation, electrification, vertical bi-facial PV panels. There are also challenges such as security of power supply.</p>
<h4>Affordable and accessible energy</h4><p>Countries accelerate the use of renewable energy sources to mitigate volatilities in supply of fossil fuels. Low-grade waste heat is prevented, recovered, or distributed through heat networks. Factories optimise energy costs with transparent price predictions and fair feed-in tariffs.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are district heating, distributed solar. Other trends are heat recovery. There are also challenges such as cloud storage energy intensity, feed-in tariffs, levelised cost of energy, fossil fuel price volatility.</p>
<h4>Reliable supply of power</h4><p>Countries are becoming less reliant on single-source oil and gas. Power and hydrogen delivered from the factory to the grid accommodate multiple complex business models. The reliability of supply, emission reductions, and energy costs are always carefully balanced. Smart distributed energy supply ensures resilience and minimises losses.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are smart grids, factory-to-grid, fuel switching, phase change materials. Other trends are regional energy parks, small modular reactors. There are also challenges such as energy transition pace.</p>




<h3>UK vision 2050</h3>
<h4>Decarbonised manufacturing system</h4><p>The power supply to all manufacturing needs to be generated from low carbon sources. The UK is well positioned to build on a strong industry to ensure a smooth energy transition. Expertise in whole system integration design and management can be leveraged to develop cost-effective long-duration energy storage. The UK has the opportunity to develop a hydrogen/ammonia grid to fuel industry and transport, supported by electrification of industrial processes. The UK can continue to build capability in the design, manufacture and through-life services to support the introduction and operation of future UK decarbonised energy supply and distribution systems.</p>
<h4>Affordable and accessible energy</h4><p>Energy efficiency measures need to be universally adopted. The UK is well paced to develop and implement these measures building on network expertise and leading system integration capability. The UK can build heat networks to prevent, recover or distribute all low-grade waste heat. Factories can optimise energy costs with transparent price predictions and fair feed-in tariffs.</p>
<h4>Reliable supply of power</h4><p>UK manufacturing needs a resilient power supply. The UK has capabilities to establish power and hydrogen factory-to-grid systems that accommodate multiple complex business models. Building on UK strengths fossil fuels can be fully displaced by renewables and small modular reactors to provide power supply inertia. Former refinery complexes can be transformed into clean energy parks. Manufacturers can create opportunity through local clean power generation with any excess being fed-in to the grid.</p>
