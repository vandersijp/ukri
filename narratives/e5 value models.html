<h2>Evolving value models</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p>Innovative business models, agility to meet demand, green financing, and balanced trade will drive manufacturing</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p>Understanding, design, customisation, and adoption of increasingly complex or even disruptive organisational business and value models</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p>The UK is well set to take advantage with its net zero policy and strategy, commitment to growth in research and development, funding for new business models, and strength in high-tech manufacturing</p><p></p>

<h3>Global outlook</h3>
<h5>Intro</h5><p>In 2050, society demands that businesses optimise environmental, economic, and societal impacts of their products and operations. Customers specify what they want, leading to universal demand for individual and customised products. Users are integral to conception and design. Manufacturing has responded to meet these complex requirements with flexible and adaptable systems. This requires the understanding, design, customisation, and adoption of increasingly complex business models.</p>
<h4>Coordinated and pertinent research</h4><p>A research and innovation framework supports change, shares best practice, and allows organisations to swiftly de-risk new business models.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are impact management. Other trends are industrial R&D returns, academic research output.</p>
<h4>Targeted and accessible financing</h4><p>Public and private sector financing models are in place to de-risk and incentivise full adoption of transformational business models.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are VC platform services, social innovation. Other trends are British Business Bank facilitation, being force for good, corporate social responsibility, environmental, social and governance (ESG).</p>
<h4>Innovative business models</h4><p>By 2050, the consumer expects a service or solution to meet a set of requirements rather than to buy and own a distinct product. Business models that were based on selling product are replaced by ones based on selling benefits. In other words, manufacturers retain ownership and responsibility, including for ongoing performance. It is recognised by 2030 that sustainable and resource-efficient business models are the most profitable. The benefits of selling services around products – servitisation – and ‘through-life engineering’ practices, enabled by digital technology and underpinned by digital threads, are accepted. Customers buy service contracts for a greater percentage of products (up to 50% of household spend). This model allows manufacturers to realise significant and consistent value from longer-life products and greater amortisation of costs, benefits that can be shared with the customer. The selling of services around products becomes dominant in multiple markets, requiring greater understanding of customer needs whilst design engineers can make quite different trade-offs in product design.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are hyper-customisation, manufacturing as a service, MaaS, shifting product ownership, cloud services. Other trends are complex value tools, end-to-end models, value framework, business model innovation, technology stacks, user-centricity, servitisation, XaaS, usage data tracking, commercialisation. There are also challenges such as tackling wicked problems, energy-food-water stress nexus, business model ownerships, user-data privacy.</p>
<h4>Open and vibrant trade</h4><p>Manufacturers with a leading position in product customisation through digitalisation increase market share in both domestic and export markets. Efficient business models enable flexibility in where, how and what manufacturers produce, rapidly meeting changing demand.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Other trends are foreign direct investment. There are also challenges such as global systemic competition, fair trading.</p>



<h3>UK vision 2050</h3>
<h4>Coordinated and pertinent research</h4><p>The UK’s respected research base and national commitments and a vibrant private investment market can grow research and development and provide the environment to ensure organisations can transform with managed and understood risk.</p>
<h4>Targeted and accessible financing</h4><p>The UK can build on existing export strengths to deliver these business models to new markets and secure long-term growth.</p>
<h4>Innovative business models</h4><p>The increased servitisation of products plays to UK strengths. UK companies lead the way in this business model. The UK also has a very strong service sector providing transferable skills and capabilities that can unlock value.</p>
<h4>Open and vibrant trade</h4><p>A stable policy framework and long-term targets, such as net zero, give confidence to UK companies to invest in next-generation business models and to meet the opportunities presented by the changing demands of customers.</p>
