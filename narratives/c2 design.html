<h2>Smart design</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p>Effective design methods, design for resource efficiency, design for maximum through-life value, and engineering biology</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p>Through-life and multidisciplinary design engineering with support of digital tools to de-risk and prototype new ideas</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p>UK strengths in high-value design, complex systems with through-life engineering and digital technologies and information management can set us apart from global competition</p><p></p>
<h3>Global outlook</h3>
<h5>Intro</h5><p>Sophisticated design tools are widely adopted to augment human capabilities with technology. Data-supported lifecycle-thinking with an associated digital thread is standard, maximising the value a product delivers and minimising the emissions locked in at the design stage. New approaches to product development are in place to provide high-quality and low-risk solutions to highly complex and rapidly evolving societal and environmental challenges.</p>
<h4>Design the right thing</h4><p>Design engineering underpins modern manufacturing sectors and is pivotal to minimising emissions, waste and improving resilience. Agility, accuracy and efficiency at the design stage supported by new technology, can minimise the 70% of a product’s lifecycle costs locked in at the design stage. Regulatory targets and increasing product complexity can all be supported by having design engineering at the core of the process from an early stage. UK has capability in through-life design and engineering of complex systems. This will build understanding of the total emissions that go into making all the materials and parts in a final product. UK expertise in through-life design will enable optimisation of the product, enhancing the resilience of material supply, and reducing emissions. The UK’s design engineering specialism has the potential to set it apart from global competition, maximising both the value a product delivers to consumers and the value businesses derive from ideas.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are biomimetics, generative design, design thinking. Other trends are causal reasoning, TRIZ revival, hybrid engineering.</p>
<h4>State-of-the-art design tools</h4><p>There is the opportunity to anchor design in the UK by being the design authority on large programmes. The UK is well-positioned to lead resource-efficient and generative design by combining technologies such as topology optimisation, biomimetics and additive manufacturing.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are mixed reality (XR), digital threads, digital twins, 4-dimensional simulation, multi-fidelity models, industrial metaverse. Other trends are immersive technologies, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR). There are also challenges such as the gaming perception of VR.</p>
<h4>New ideas being de-risked fast</h4><p>Expertise in high-value design engineering and complex systems integration puts the UK in a strong position for value-added growth from embedding digital innovations in design engineering and production. The product design process can be agile and digital, with design engineers working across multiple disciplines to optimise solutions. The UK’s respected regulatory framework can be developed to support rapid and flexible design assurance to improve speed to market and reduce the risks associated with commercialisation. Digital design and simulation tools can make the UK more attractive to investors by bridging the ‘valley of death’ that novel products and services often face.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are fail fast, rapid prototyping, living labs. Other trends are risk identification, de-risking processes, innovation readiness levels, venture capital exits, idea stage gates, celebrating failure stories.</p>
