<h2>net zero and resource efficient</h2>
<h5>Purpose</h5><p class="cap">To understand the environmental impact of every stage in the supply chain and manufacturing process and widely adopting sustainable practices</p><p></p>
<p>A net zero and resource-efficient UK sector will understand environmental impact across the full lifecycle, including emissions embedded in raw materials, in distribution, in manufacture, in use and at end of life, whether these activities occur in the UK or overseas.</p>

<p>Regulatory requirements will make clean and resource-efficient business models the most profitable. UK businesses will be recognised as global leaders in sustainability and this will enhance their competitiveness.</p>
<p>Businesses will seek to extract the full value from resources, minimise waste and deliver a circular economy. Activity will ultimately be regenerative, restoring rather than exploiting resources, such that manufacturing makes a net-positive contribution to achieving climate targets.</p>
<p>Design engineering will be optimised to reduce material use and human-centred to help reduce and manage demand. Recycling and reuse will be increased, and product life will be greatly improved.</p>
<p>Product use and sharing will increase, and materials that we see as ‘waste’ today will be valued. These materials will be sold into new markets or adapted as a feedstock for production of chemicals, low-carbon fuels and materials (for example through catalytic or biotechnological processes), reducing reliance on virgin feedstocks.</p>
