<h2>Longer in use & reuse</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p class="cap">Minimal material waste, practicing complete traceability, and new remanufacturing services</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p class="cap">Connections between all communities and individuals working on innovation</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p class="cap">The UK has many advantages including a thriving network of researchers, developers and investors, a strong Catapults network, ambitious industrial policies, and leadership in areas such as food safety and traceability, use of data and cyber security</p><p></p>

<h3>Global outlook</h3>

<h5>Intro</h5><p>2050 products have a life two-to-three times longer than in 2020. This is driven by changes in customer demand and by legislation and regulation. Fewer products containing less material deliver the same or greater value for the customer for longer, supporting a reduction to near zero in the flow of waste.</p>

<h4>The right behaviour to retain value</h4><p>A change in design process and approach will be needed to deliver products that last longer and are more easily reused. We will need design engineers with revised skills but importantly also the supporting tools and processes. The UK’s design engineering, software and manufacturing capabilities mean it is well positioned to deliver these future tools and exploit the significant future value they will offer.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are collaborative consumption, responsible design, distributed ledgers. Other trends are behavioural change, responsible use, people, planet and profit, design for repair, leapfrogging, asset tracking, product labelling, extended producer responsibility. There are also challenges such as designed obsolescence.</p>
<h4>Product value retention</h4><p>Product monitoring and tracking has enormous potential for growth. Communications industries and systems engineers will need to develop the sensor technologies required. The UK has strengths and is a leader in monitoring with internet of things so is well positioned to develop and deliver systems.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are aftermarket service, right to repair, reverse logistics networks. Other trends are cross-sector analysis. There are also challenges such as warranties by OEMs.</p>
<h4>End-of-life resource recovery</h4><p>Maximising the useful life and value of products is already worth £53 billion to the UK and supports around 475,000 jobs. There are significant growth opportunities. The UK is well placed to build on strong research activity, excellent standards development and well-established remanufacturing industries in sectors such as aerospace. Decommissioning, materials and waste sorting recycling expertise across multiple sectors strengthens this position. The UK can establish systems to efficiently extract and reclaim critical minerals and materials from waste.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are reverse vending machines. Other trends are waste infrastructure, waste collection, waste separation, oil & gas rig dismantling, telecom wire recovery. </p>
