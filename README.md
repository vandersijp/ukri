## Objective

The objective is to automatically map projects against 13 narratives (i.e. 10 areas and 3 imperatives).

Each narrative is syntactically structured with a header hierarchy to improve the accuracy of the mapping. The text is identical to the one published in www.ukri.org/reimagine-manufacturing.

Each project description consists of a **title** and the **public description** as submitted during their application.

The 'mapping' illustrates how relevant a narrative relates to a project. It is a relative measure and could be reported for **each project** as:


**narrative → relevance**

- c1 → 12.7
- c2 → 93.8
- c3 → 64.9
- c4 → 38.2
- c5 → 75.7
- e1 → 19.0
- e2 → 51.0
- e3 → 14.1
- e4 → 31.8
- e5 → 72.9

**narrative → relevance**

- s1 → 98.3
- s2 → 26.5
- s3 → 36.3


It is important that all relevances have been consistently calibrated. Both between the 10 areas, between the 3 imperatives, as well as between all projects.
