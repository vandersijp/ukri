## Objective

The objective is to automatically map projects against 13 narratives (i.e. 10 areas and 3 inperatives).

Each narrative is syntactically structured with a header hierarchy to improve the accuracy of the mapping. The text is identical to the one published in www.ukri.org/reimagine-manufacturing.

Each project description consists of a title and the public description as submitted during their application.

The 'mapping' represents how relevant a narrative relates to a project. It is a relative measure and could be reported for each projected as:

narrative	relevance


narrative | relevance

c1	 |	12.7

c2	 |	93.8

c3	 |	64.9

c4	 |	38.2

c5	 |	75.7

e1	 |	19.0

e2	 |	51.0

e3	 |	14.1

e4	 |	31.8

e5	 |	72.9


s1	 |	98.3

s2	 |	26.5

s3	 |	36.3


It is important that the relevancies are callibrated consistently. Both between the 10 areas, as well as between the 3 imnperatives.
