## Objective

The objective is to test a proof of concept to automate the mapping of 10 projects against a set of 13 narratives (i.e. 10 areas and 3 imperatives). The 'mapping' helps to analyse a project portfolio by illustrating how relevant each project is to each of the narratives.

- Each narrative is **syntactically structured** with a header hierarchy to improve the accuracy of the mapping. Their content is a verbatim copy from the Innovate UK vision for materials and manufacturing as published on www.ukri.org/reimagine-manufacturing.
- Each project description consists of a **title** and the **public description** as submitted during their application. In the future, other project information will be used to improve the mapping.

Relevance is a relative measure and could be reported for each individual project as:


**narrative → relevance**

- c1 → 12.7
- c2 → 93.8
- c3 → 64.9
- c4 → 38.2
- c5 → 75.7
- e1 → 19.0
- e2 → 51.0
- e3 → 14.1
- e4 → 31.8
- e5 → 72.9

**narrative → relevance**

- s1 → 98.3
- s2 → 26.5
- s3 → 36.3


It is critically important that all relevances are consistently calibrated between all narratives and all projects.
