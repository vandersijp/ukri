<h2>Future skills</h2>
<h5>Vision</h5><p class="cap">Courageous leadership, critical skills foresight, upskilling and diverse talent attraction will drive UK manufacturing in all nations and regions</p><p></p>
<h5>Scope</h5><p class="cap">Through-life and multidisciplinary design engineering with support of digital tools to de-risk and prototype new ideas</p><p></p>
<h5>UK strengths</h5><p class="cap">UK strengths in high-value design, complex systems with through-life engineering and digital technologies and information management can set us apart from global competition</p><p></p>

<h3>Global outlook</h3>

<h5>Intro</h5><p>The nature of work in materials and manufacturing is changing at an unprecedented pace. To ensure resilience, the sectors need the leadership, management and technical capability to anticipate and adapt to multiple challenges. By 2030, the demand for physical and manual skills declines by 30% and the demand for technological and complex cognitive skills rises by 50%, including for high-level social and emotional skills as well as initiative- taking and entrepreneurship.</p>

<h4>Demand projection of critical skills</h4><p>The nature of UK employment will change where digitalisation drives employment by work packages and deliverables rather than by large permanent workforces. The UK can take advantage of an excellent research base in decision sciences to link business priorities with data analysis, design and behavioural understanding. This will support the development of tools for foresighting that help to close gaps in skills and understand future needs.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p> Other trends are skills foresighting, skills gaps, skills value chain. There are also challenges such as stranded skills.</p>
<h4>Technical & non-technical leadership skills</h4><p>Building on existing programmes, opportunities to strengthen this pipeline through apprenticeships and technician training will be readily available and appealing. This development of skills will be a vital part of making UK manufacturing competitive.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are systems thinking. Other trends are collaboration skills, commercialisation skills, critical thinking. There are also challenges such as authenticity, cultural intelligence (CQ), promise management.</p>
<h4>Highly capable workforce</h4><p>Student enrolment is growing in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This can provide a strong pipeline of skilled people able to adopt increasingly complex and evolving value models. Ultimately, the demand for jobs can be met domestically. Distributed, collaborative and flexible working can be developed to provide the right balance to attract the best and most innovative talent.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are gig economy, learning factories. Other trends are cross-skilling, job rotation, digital nomadism, apprenticeship schemes, T-levels, teaching factory, skills value chain. There are also challenges such as brain drain, job meaningfulness.</p>
<h4>Levelled up society</h4><p>UK companies are well placed to broadly adopt a culture of caring commitment to their people, offering flexibility and opportunity. The UK can become a global reference point for the quality of its manufacturing workforce and its approaches to developing the workforce across all sectors and stages of career.</p><h5>Trends and challenges</h5><p>Promissing trends are virtual classrooms. Other trends are re-skilling, lifelong learning, skills modularity. There are also challenges such as job polarisation, education funding, long tail in digital.</p>
