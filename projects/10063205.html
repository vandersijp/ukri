<h3>MAPPED: Modelling of Alloy Process Parameters for Enhanced Development</h3>
<p>Competition: A-0315 REforMM FS<p/> {1327)
<h4>Public description</h4>
<p>One of the best approaches to improve the resource efficiency of materials is to develop better materials. This can reduce emissions through more efficient performance and reduced costs. However, material development requires the identification of both a new material formula and the development of a viable commercial production process.This project aims to demonstrate the viability of using the latest in computer modelling to rapidly identify the optimal process conditions for the production of new materials. This is expected to greatly reduce the time and cost of getting them to market by several years.</p>
