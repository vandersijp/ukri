<h3>Additive Manufacturing for Repair and Re-use of Castings - AdCast</h3>
<p>Competition: A-0476 REforMM CR&D<p/> {1521)
<h4>Public description</h4>
<p>AdCast is a radical approach to reduce the loss of high-value metal-cast products in two key areas: in the foundry and in the field. 5% of castings are scrapped as unrepairable, due to defects, generating thousands of tonnes scrap globally per year. A further 20% of defective castings are re-heated and manually repaired using large amounts of gas.</p><p>To achieve this game-changing advance three technologies will be combined for the first time:</p><p>Directed Energy Deposition (DED) to deposit metal repairs on challenging high-chrome cast substrates.</p><p>Metal wire feedstock for DED, optimised for the repair of high chrome-content white iron castings, notoriously hard and difficult to repair.</p><p>AI-assisted software. 3D scanning will compare defect to nominal CAD shape and automatically generate the 3D additive weld path and calibrate to the target casting location.</p><p>This Additive Repair (AdR) approach will change the repair of high-specification cast structures (in the foundry and in the field) from a risky, resource-intensive operation taking days of oven heating and manual labour with variable results and poor financial viability, to an intelligent, self-improving and efficient operation taking hours, requiring no pre-heating.</p>
