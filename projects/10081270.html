<h3>ENIGMATEC: Efficient Netshape manufacturInG for reduced MAterials waste in production or ThermoElectric Coolers</h3>
<p>Competition: A-0476 REforMM CR&D (1521)</p>
<h4>Public description</h4>
<p>95% of thermoelectric devices are manufactured in China, Russia or the Ukraine. Thermoelectric end users have experienced extreme supply chain issue over the last 3 years and are seeking a UK based manufacturing solution with inherently more resilient supply. Greater than 50% of the material is wasted in the manufacture of commercial devices today due to a slicing and dicing approach. ENIGMATEC directly addresses this to deliver an industrial scale net-shape sintering process that reduces material loses. The project also develops automated thermoelectric leg inspection and digital module design tools to enable UK manufacture to be globally competitive.</p><p>ENIGMATEC has the overall objectives to develop an industrial scale thermoelectric sintering process capable of sintering bismuth telluride materials to \> 99% theoretical density with complex leg shape capability.</p><p>The technology will transform the commercial prospects of IML and ETL, high tech SMEs enabling them to secure cumulative revenues of Â£52 million by 2030 and creating 55 highly skilled jobs.</p>
